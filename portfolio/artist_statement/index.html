    <h1>Artist statement</h1>
<div class="box">  
    <p> Currently, I’m an international student from South Korea studying interaction design at Columbia College of Chicago. I want to be a designer who can actually express what I imagine, not thinking of a stereotypical design. When I walk through the streets where I have traveled, most buildings and crosswalks have similar structures. The buildings are rectangular and the crosswalks have been designed with black color and white dashed lines. In my perspective, they don’t necessarily need to be designed like that. I always wonder when I see formal designs in general. The buildings can be decorated using a variety of geometrical shapes rather than rectangular cubes. Instead of using boring black and white, it will be more attractive when using color on the crosswalks. Like this, I want to be a unique and creative designer, not create designs that people generally think of.</p>

    <p>Before I studied at university, I did not understand the phrase "inspired". However, when I went to college and worked on art that I had to create myself, I thought I needed an element to be inspired. At first, I didn't know how to be inspired. So I researched through art books and saw many designs. However, the more I tried to be inspired, the more I could think of nothing. Meanwhile, when I was working on designing a smartphone application’s interface, I suddenly looked out the window while I was thinking about the color arrangement. The colorful Chicago buildings inspired me to create a new color pallet. Everything in the real world is an inspiration.</p>

    Last semester, my final project in Fundamental of Interaction class was to design the interface of the application of my invention. It was a little hard to come up with ideas because there was no set topic and no guidelines. However, I thought about what applications would be useful to users through brainstorming. As an international student, I go back to Korea every vacation and come back to the US. In the process, I had to book a plane ticket myself, but whenever I booked a plane, I didn't like the complicated interface of the flight reservation application I used. Therefore, I developed an application that allows all users to book plane
    tickets simply. I tried to develop using intuitive functions and simple designs as much as possible. At least five feedbacks were received while designing the application's interface. Although I was not required to receive feedback, I got feedback for my work from professors, peers, family and friends to develop an application interface that everyone can use comfortably. Based on the feedback I received, I designed a cool application interface by modifying the design a little and adding more of my imagination. The process was really hard and exhausting, but I was excited and interested to create something through my idea. When the application interface was completed, and I gave a presentation in class; the feeling was the most thrilling and happy feeling I had ever felt in my life.
