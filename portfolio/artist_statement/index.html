                        I’m an international student from South Korea studying interaction design at Columbia College of Chicago. I want to be a designer who can actually express what I imagine, not thinking of a stereotypical design. When I walk through the streets where I have traveled, most buildings and crosswalks have similar structures. The buildings are rectangular and the crosswalks have been designed with black color and white dashed lines.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                         In my perspective, they don’t necessarily need to be designed like that. I always wonder when I see formal designs in general. The buildings can be decorated using a variety of geometrical shapes rather than rectangular cubes. Instead of using boring black and white, it will be more attractive when using color on the crosswalks.
                         <br>
                         <br>
                          Like this, I want to be a unique and creative designer, not create designs that people generally think of.

                     Before I studied at university, I did not understand the phrase "inspired". However, when I went to college and worked on art that I had to create myself, I thought I needed an element to be inspired. 
                     <br>
                     At first, I didn't know how to be inspired. So I researched through art books and saw many designs. However, the more I tried to be inspired, the more I could think of nothing. Meanwhile, when I was working on designing a smartphone application’s interface, I suddenly looked out the window while I was thinking about the color arrangement. The colorful Chicago buildings inspired me to create a new color pallet.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                    <strong> Everything in the real world is an inspiration.</strong>
                    <br>

                    Last semester, my final project in Fundamental of Interaction class was to design the interface of the application of my invention. It was a little hard to come up with ideas because there was no set topic and no guidelines. However, I thought about what applications would be useful to users through brainstorming. As an international student, I go back to Korea every vacation and come back to the US. In the process, I had to book a plane ticket myself, but whenever I booked a plane, I didn't like the complicated interface of the flight reservation application I used. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Therefore, I developed an application that allows all users to book plane
                    tickets simply. I tried to develop using intuitive functions and simple designs as much as possible. At least five feedbacks were received while designing the application's interface. Although I was not required to receive feedback, I got feedback for my work from professors, peers, family and friends to develop an application interface that everyone can use comfortably.

                    <br>
                    Based on the feedback I received, I designed a cool application interface by modifying the design a little and adding more of my imagination. The process was really hard and exhausting, but I was excited and interested to create something through my idea. When the application interface was completed, and I gave a presentation in class; the feeling was the most thrilling and happy feeling I had ever felt in my life.
