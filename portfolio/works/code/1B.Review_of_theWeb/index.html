 <header>Son's review of the Web </header>

<p>The Internet is developing geometrically with the development of technology. It has already achieved a lot of development, but it continues to develop its functions. As a result, people are enjoying a more convenient life thanks to the development of the Internet. However, the development of the Internet is not the only advantage. I think the biggest problem in my view is the leakage of personal information through the Internet. And websites designed for bad purposes are designed to obtain people's personal information and can lead to crime. Also, the current Internet is only made for the younger generation. Most things are connected to the Internet through the development of the Internet, but some younger generations have grown along with the Internet and are not used to it. I think we need to make the use of the Internet easier to narrow the gap.
I can no longer imagine a life that is not on the Internet. Users should also make efforts to protect the convenient internet.
